## ðŸ“– Overview

Pypg2BiqQuery is a project aimed at simplifying and automating data synchronization between a local PostgreSQL database and Google BigQuery on the Google Cloud platform. 
This project consists of two main scripts: db_to_csv.py and load_csv.py. 
Both scripts operate at the desired frequency to ensure consistency and constant data updates between the two platforms.
